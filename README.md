# Advent of Code

My solutions to the **2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** event, using **Python 3.8** with **[Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)** for dependency management.

Use Pipenv to reproduce the Python environment:
```
pipenv sync
```

And then run solutions for a specific day:
```
pipenv run day 1
```
